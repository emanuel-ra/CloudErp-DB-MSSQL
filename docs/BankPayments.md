### Notes

- **Folio**: Automatically generated as `PD-XXXX`, where `XXXX` is the `Id` converted to a string.
- **Nullable Fields**: The columns `ValidatedByUserId`, `PaymentDate`, `StartedAt`, and `ValidatedAt` can be `NULL`, allowing flexibility in the workflow of payment validation.
- **Image Storage**: Both `ClientReceiptImageUrl` and `BankDepositImageUrl` are used to store references to the images, which may be stored externally.

### Default Values

- `Amount`: Defaults to `0`.
- `CreatedAt`: Defaults to the current timestamp when the record is inserted.
- `UpdatedAt`: Automatically updated with the current timestamp whenever the record is modified.
- `StatusId`: Defaults to `1` (assumed to represent 'pending').
- `IsPaymentValid`: Defaults to `0` (false, meaning the payment has not been validated yet).
